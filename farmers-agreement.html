Because this is a one-worker operation and there are only 24 hours in my day, I
have set up a few rules to make everything run smoothly. Thanks for your
patience!
<ul>
<li>
The 2020 season runs from April 14 to December 8 and there are 35 weeks of
baskets in total.
</li>
<li>
The price per basket is $28 for on-farm pick up, and $33 for home delivery.
</li>
<li>
Baskets that are not picked up by 7pm on pick up day will not be
replaced, unless the member lets me know in advance. Your basket
was packed for you.
</li>
<li>
If you chose to have your basket delivered to your home I cannot
vouch for the freshness if you are not home at delivery time (between
8-10 am), but we will try to find a shaded cool spot (please let us
know where you would like it).
</li>
<li>
If you choose to pick up your basket at the farm, please pick up the
basket at your earliest convenience (Tuesdays after 8:00 am) for the
freshest produce.
</li>
<li>
Payments: I use the software Farmigo to help me keep track of
payments, members, and crops. You have online access to your
account, and can make changes without having to track me down. I
accept payment via Paypal, or credit card through Paypal. You do not
have to have a Paypal account to pay through Paypal. Payment is by
monthly installments that are automatically charged every month on
the due date, and you will receive an email notification. The total
subscription fee will be evenly divided into the installments so that
each monthly payment will be the same even though some months
will have more Tuesdays than others.
</li>
<li>
Vacations: If you cannot pick up your box on a given week you can
put your subscription on hold while you are gone. Please go to your
online account to do that.
</li>
<li>
Please give me one-month notice if you want to cancel your
membership. Unused balances will be fully refunded.
</li>
<li>
Quality: If at any time you believe you have received poor quality
produce just email me at malinkerr@gmail.com and I will pack a
replacement of that item with the next basket.
</li>
<li>
Please return your baskets and small plastic berry containers for me
to reuse.
</li>
<li>
Please read the newsletter in each basket as I may announce
changes in delivery, prices, or policies there. Thanks!
