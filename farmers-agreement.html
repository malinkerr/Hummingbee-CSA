<div class="section" id="about-section">
<p>Because this is a one-worker operation and there are only 24 hours in
my day, I have set up a few rules to make everything run smoothly.
Thanks for your patience!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The 2025 season runs from April 15 to December 16 and there are
33 weeks of baskets in total. There will be no basket of July 1, 8 and
15.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The price per basket is $42 for on-farm pick up, and $47 for home
delivery.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Baskets that are not picked up by 7pm on pick up day will not be
replaced, unless the member lets me know in advance. Your basket was
packed for you.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If you chose to have your basket delivered to your home I cannot
vouch for the freshness if you are not home at delivery time (between
8-10 am), but we will try to find a shaded cool spot (please let us know
where you would like it).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If you choose to pick up your basket at the farm, please pick up
the basket at your earliest convenience (Tuesdays after 8:00 am) for the
freshest produce.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Payments: I use the software Farmigo to help me keep track of
payments, members, and crops. You have online access to your account,
and can make changes without having to track me down. I accept payment
via PayPal, or credit card through PayPal. Payment is by monthly
installments that are automatically charged every month on the due date,
and you will receive an email notification. The total subscription fee
will be evenly divided into the installments so that each monthly
payment will be the same even though some months will have more Tuesdays
than others. If you are unable to sign up through PayPal let me know and
we can agree on a different form of payment.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Vacations: If you cannot pick up your box on a given week you can
put your subscription on hold while you are gone. Please go to your
online account to do that.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Please give me one-month notice if you want to cancel your
membership. Unused balances will be fully refunded.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Quality: If at any time you believe you have received poor
quality produce just email me at <u>malinkerr@gmail.com</u> and I will
pack a replacement of that item with the next basket.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Please return your baskets and small plastic berry containers for
me to reuse.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Please read the newsletter in each basket as I may announce
changes in delivery, prices, or policies there. Thanks!</p></li>
